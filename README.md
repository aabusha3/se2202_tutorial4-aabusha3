# Tutorial 4
Please note that the main objective of the tutorial is for you to practice working with the concepts discussed in the course. You might have more efficient or more clever ways to do the given tasks, and I appreciate that. However, let's use this tutorial to exercise the concepts, and you can demonstrate your competence in the mini-projects.

## Task 1: Parsing a JSON-like string to a plain JS object
In this task, you'll write a function that takes a string containing a simple JSON object (with only simple valued properties) according to the following steps
Please note that this is an over-simplification to make the task more reasonable. So, we're going to ignore the fact that in JSON objects, the names of the properties need to be surrounded by quotes and that the values could be arrays or other objects.

## Task 2: Functions with "rest parameter"

In this task you'll write a function that would take a threshold and a variable number of arrays and returns the the first array that has all elements meeting the given threshold.

## A note about marking
The assignment will be marked out of 50. 20 marks are based on the automated tests, and the rest will be based on actual code.
- Attempts to manipulate the code to pass the automated tests fictitiously will result in a zero mark.
